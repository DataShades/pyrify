# You can delete the column from the list to keep it as is.

# You can use the following commands relative to the table name:
# - clean: clean the table

# - nullify: set the column to null
# - fake_name: set the column to a fake name
# - fake_email: set the column to a fake email
# - fake_password: set the column to a fake password
